 We study DNN training by Fourier analysis. Our theoretical framework explains why DNNs trained by (stochastic) gradient-based methods often endow low-frequency components of the target function with a higher priority during the training. Small initialization leads to good generalization ability of DNN while preserving the DNN’s ability to fit any function. These results are further conﬁrmed by experiments of DNNs ﬁtting the following datasets, that is, natural images, one-dimensional functions and MNIST dataset.
